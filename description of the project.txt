Topic: Analysis of TV Series based on information scraped out of metacritic.com

Short Introduction: 
Using Metacritic, i hoped to find out if there were patterns of different tv series that contribute to their success or downfall.

If there was a pattern in big networks as to how they choose their programs or how they distribute their time slots between different genres.

Finally, if seasons of the year is a factor in the difference of user votes. whether it be shows chosen by networks for a certain season
or just an over change in voters' voting pattern
